# Stampede Management in Kumbh Mela with Ubiquitous Computing

An executive presentation on stampede management at Kumbh Mela with EdgeAI crowd flow, emotion analytics, predictive communication. This is developed as a part of 'Pervasive Computing' assignment at BITS Pilani.

## Original Assignment Question:
You are required to prepare and submit a short presentation consisting of just 2 to 3 slides on any one of the topics listed below.
Suggested Topics:
- A unique device designed to solve any day-to-day problem
- Biological implants (e.g., Pacemakers, Neural implants, etc.)
- Mechatronics-based devices
- IoT-driven applications
- Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) – choose any industry and explore how Ubicomp can transform it
- Future of Ubicomp – Vision for 2030 & Beyond
- Next-Generation Technologies
- Cell Phone Battery Technologies
- Electric Vehicles (EVs), Chargers & Related Innovations
- Eco-friendly & Smart Devices
- Or any other topic related to Pervasive Computing
 Tip: Be creative, innovative, and concise — your slides should focus on key ideas rather than lengthy explanations.




## Motivation
Kumbh Mela draws millions of pilgrims, with historical stampedes, underscoring the need for pervasive tech. Maha Kumbh 2025 achieved breakthroughs like 95% accurate AI heatmaps from 300+ cameras/drones and 1.5M RFID wristbands for tracking, but lagged in real-time impacts due to centralized commands and behavioral blind spots.

## 2025 Successes
- **AI Data Analytics**: 24x7 situational awareness via head-counting and heatmaps.
- **RFID/IoT Integration**: Real-time people tracking and missing-person resolutions.
- **Bhashini Kumbh SahAIyak Chatbot**: Multilingual guidance for pilgrims.

## 2025 Gaps & Challenges
- Centralized dependency delayed edge decisions during peaks.
- Fragmented alerts missed due to language/connectivity issues.
- No analytics for emotion/panic patterns or environmental factors.

**Key Takeaway**: Tech detects well but lacks context interpretation and adaptation.

## Proposed Ubicomp Vision for 2028
A self-learning ecosystem turning the world's largest gathering into a human-aware, adaptive event:
- **EdgeAI Crowd Flow**: Autonomous rerouting at ghats to prevent choke points.
- **Emotion-Aware Analytics**: AI detects unrest through movement/expressions, triggers de-escalation.
- **Predictive Communication**: Sensor-triggered, multilingual alerts on phones/wearables/signages.
- **Smart Mobility**: IoT-controlled transit and geo-fenced pathways.
- **Ambient Intelligence**: Smart lighting/soundscapes for intuitive guidance.

**Expected Impact**: Shift from monitoring to anticipation and inclusive safety.

## Tech Stack
- **AI/ML**: Crowd heatmaps, behavioral prediction.
- **IoT**: RFIDs, sensors, wearables.
- **Edge Computing**: Autonomous decisions.
